# Scrapingbypass API proxy tool

?> It is recommended to use in Java projects, collectors and other services.
> Calling the Scrapingbypass API service through the Scrapingbypass API Proxy Client is suitable for complex session requests, such as login, session redirection requests, etc. Users only need to add proxy parameters to the original request, and the Scrapingbypass API Proxy Client will automatically forward the proxy request to the Scrapingbypass API service.

### Startup Command

> Use the following command to enable the preset apikey. You do not need to set the `x-cb-apikey` request header in subsequent calls.

```shell
# Use the default apikey
> cfb-mitm -k 0000000000000000 -x http:example.io:1288 -l 127.0.0.1:1087

# OUTPUT
# api.cloudbypass.com -> 127.0.0.1:1087
# Please use proxy 127.0.0.1:1087
```

?> If -k or -x is not set, it can be dynamically configured via the request headers `x-cb-apikey` and `x-cb-proxy`.
